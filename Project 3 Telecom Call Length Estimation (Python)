Project: Telecom Call Length Estimation

Description:
This is a real-life project that was developed for a telecom company interested in understanding the duration of their customer calls. The original dataset comprises transcribed call data but lacks direct information about call lengths. 
To address this, the project implements a Python script to estimate call durations based on the number of words in each call transcript.

The script processes an Excel file containing the transcribed calls and then estimates call lengths using the word count method. 
Each call's estimated duration is categorized into clusters based on its length in minutes.

Implementation:
The script is written in Python and utilizes the pandas and numpy libraries for data manipulation and calculations.

Key Components:
- Reads call data from an Excel file.
- Estimates call lengths for each transcript in the 'Kund' column by calculating word count and converting this to estimated minutes based on a rate of 110 words per minute.
- Categorizes estimated call lengths into defined clusters (1-3 min, 4-7 min, 8-12 min, and 13+ min).
- Saves the modified data, including estimated lengths and categories, back to the Excel file.
